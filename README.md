# HackYourFuture - Serverless MASTERCLASS

In this 6-week module we will build a serverless application from scratch using AWS services. 

To get more specific, the students will gain knowledge on how to:
- deploy, host and manage static web applications in the cloud
- create serverless REST or GraphQL APIs
- create timebased, event-based and trigger based Lambda functions

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills or the Javascript module courses offered by Hack Your Future.
- In order to attend this Masterclass, we recommend that you have foundational cloud practitioner skills (15 hours of training). 

You can pursue the course AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials on [AWS Skill Builder](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/internal/view/elearning/134/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials) or on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/aws-cloud-practitioner-essentials). 

You can also pursue a new game-based role-playing experience, called [AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11458/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner). AWS Cloud Quest teaches foundational cloud computing concepts while learners zap drones and collect gems in their quest to solve challenges in a virtual city.

## Preparation

Materials and guides from the preparation section for each week should be read before class. Mandatory homework exercises should also be completed on a weekly basis.

## Environment setup

This course assumes that you have an existing AWS environment. 

We will go through environment setup in the first week of the course.
